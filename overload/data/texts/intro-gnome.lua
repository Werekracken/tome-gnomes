Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

You are a gnome. You are distantly related to dwarves, but look more like a small halfling without the furry feet.

You are curious and fun loving and those are the qualities that got you into trouble and you have taken on debt to pay for repairs. Being more adventurous than many of your kind and capable of dispatching foes much larger than you, you decide to try to make money the old fashioned way: adventuring.
